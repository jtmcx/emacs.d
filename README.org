* Emacs Config

This is my emacs setup.

I was a Vim user for over ten years. In 2022, I discovered [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]],
and hopped over to the dark side. Doom is great, but it does a little
too much hand-holding (after a year of Doom, my emacs-fu still felt
weak). I eventually dropped Doom and started fresh with what is now
this config.
