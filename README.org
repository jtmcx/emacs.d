* Emacs Config

This is my emacs setup.

I was a Vim user for over ten years; I hopped over to the dark side
around 2022 after being introduced to [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]]. Doom is great, but
it hides a /lot/ of details from the user. As a result, I felt like my
emacs-fu was still weak after a year of Doom. In an effort to
understand emacs better, I dropped Doom and started anew with this
config.

This config still feels a bit like Doom, but is built on top of [[https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca][elpaca]]
and [[https://github.com/meow-edit/meow][meow]].
